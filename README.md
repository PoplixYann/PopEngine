# PopEngine
Pop Engine is a personal project, which i do during my free time.
I work on it to improve my skills in engine programming.

The foundation of the project is a lot based on the series "Game Engine" from the youtuber [TheCherno](https://github.com/TheCherno).

Pop Engine is write in C++ and uses :
- [Premake](https://premake.github.io/) for multi-platform and IDE project generation.
- [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) for multi-platform window and OpenGL context.
- OpenGL for rendering.
- [Glad](https://glad.dav1d.de/) for using modern OpenGL.
- [GLM](https://github.com/g-truc/glm) as mathematics library.
- [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) for GUI.
- [spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog) for logging.
